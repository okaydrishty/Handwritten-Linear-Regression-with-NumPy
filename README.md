# Handwritten-Linear-Regression-with-NumPy
## Overview

This project implements linear regression from scratch using NumPy, without relying on libraries like Scikit-Learn. It provides a hands-on understanding of the fundamental mechanics behind linear regression, including gradient descent, loss calculation, and prediction.

## Features

Manual Linear Regression: Implemented without using any high-level ML libraries.

Gradient Descent Optimization: Updates weights iteratively to minimize Mean Squared Error (MSE).

Train/Test Split: Supports evaluation on unseen data.

Performance Metrics: Calculates Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ² Score.

Customizable Parameters: Users can set learning rate, number of epochs, and initial weights.
